This is a demo basezf application, primarily developed to provide a clean
implementation of the Zend Framework.

INSTALLATION
=======================================================================
This application requires that you either have Zend Framework on your
include_path, or that you will be symlinking your Zend Framework library
into the library directory. If you do not yet have Zend Framework, you
can get it from one of the following sources:

  * Official Release:
    http://framework.zend.com/dowload/latest

  * Subversion; use either the current trunk or the 1.9.2 release branch:
    svn co http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend

    svn co http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.9.2/library/Zend

Install Zend Framework locally, and the follow these steps:

1. Run the "make config" commande and answer questions:

    cd <myproject_path>
    make config

2. Init your environment

    cp <myproject_path>/includes/auto_prepend_local.php-dist <myproject_path>/includes/auto_prepend_local.php
    set ZF_PATH value on <myproject_path>/includes/auto_prepend_local.php to Zend Framework path (without library/)

2. Add Apache config generated by "make config":

    ln -s <myproject_path>/etc/apache.conf /etc/apache2/site-available/001-myproject
    ln -s /etc/apache2/site-available/001-myproject /etc/apache2/site-enable/001-myproject
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

STRUCTURE
=======================================================================

   <myproject_path>/
    |
    |-> app/                        - This directory contains your application. It will house the
    |   |                             MVC system, as well as configurations, services used, and your
    |   |                             bootstrap file.
    |   |
    |   |-> Bootstrap.php           - This file is the entry point for your application. The purpose
    |   |                             for this file is to bootstrap the application and make
    |   |                             components available to the application by initializing them.
    |   |                             This file should not call dispatch() on the front controller.
    |   |-> controllers/
    |   |-> views/
    |       |-> filters/
    |       |-> helpers/            - These directories will contain view helpers. View helpers will
    |       |                         be namespaced either as "App_View_Helper_<HelperName>" on
    |       |                         <HelperName>.php file
    |       |
    |       |-> layouts/            - This layout directory is for MCV-based layouts.
    |       |-> scripts/
    |
    |-> bin/
    |-> data/                       - This directory provides a place to store application data that
    |                                 is volatile and possibly temporary. The disturbance of data in
    |                                 this directory might cause the application to fail. Also, the
    |                                 information in this directory may or may not be committed to a
    |                                 subversion repository. Examples of things in this directory
    |                                 are session files, cache files, sqlite databases, logs and
    |                                 indexes.
    |
    |-> doc/                        - This directory contains documentation, either generated or
    |                                 directly authored.
    |
    |-> etc/                        - The application-wide configuration directory
    |-> includes/
    |-> lib/                        - This directory houses of PHP libraries folder which contains
    |                                 BaseZF and MyProject. Developers should also place their
    |                                 application's library code under this directory in a separate
    |                                 namespace- ie, a namespace that does not begin with 'Zend'.
    |-> locale/
    |-> public/                     - This directory contains all public files for your application.
    |                                 index.php sets up the PHP environment, include the
    |                                 Bootstrap.php file from your app/ directory and finally
    |                                 dispatch() the front controller. The web root of your web
    |                                 server would typically be set to this directory.
    |-> sql/
    |-> tests/                      - This directory contains application tests. These could be hand
                                      written, phpunit , tests selenium based tests or based on some
                                      other testing framework. By default, library code can be
                                      tested by mimicing the directory structure of your library/
                                      directory. Additionally, functional tests for your application
                                      could be written mimicing the app/ directory and subdirectory
                                      structure.
